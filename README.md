Create training data for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) deep learning

A Java based project using my own Semantic Lexicon for creating word sense disambiguation training data for deep learning.
WordNet does not provide a clear enough set of semantic nouns, so I've created my own clear and practical training set.
